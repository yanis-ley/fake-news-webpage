Fake News in the past and its origins
Fake news is about as old as news and human communication, like the Battle of Kadesh (1274 BC).
Kadesh (1274 BC), where the pharaoh Ramses the Second "turned" a shocked defeat by the Hittites into a triumphant victory and had it
into a triumphant victory and he had it depicted in a monumental relief.
Fake news has therefore almost always been used for political purposes.
In 1475, the Franciscan preacher Bernardino de Feltr brought Fake News into circulation,
that Jews had kidnapped a two-year-old child to drink its blood at Passover. This
rumour has persisted for centuries.
Jews were usually chosen as victims for Fake News at that time, such as in 1144, when an
English apprentice was found dead in the woods and it was thought that the Jews were responsible.
Or in the outbreak of the plague in the 14th century, the Jews again got all the hate of their non-Jewish fellow citizens.
of their non-Jewish fellow citizens, who were accused of having poisoned the wells and thus
and that the plague could have broken out that way.

Dealing with fake news should be learned at an early age, i.e. parents should help their child to get a sense of which information could be genuine and which not.  
The school should also talk to the students about world events and help them to classify and question news and opinions. A field trip to a media outlet or a media workshop in which they do their own journalistic work is also helpful.  
Especially on the internet, parents should make it clear to their child to check information and not to share it carelessly.
